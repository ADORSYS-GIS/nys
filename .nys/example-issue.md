# User Authentication System

## Problem Statement
The application needs a secure user authentication system to protect user data and provide personalized experiences.

## Requirements
- User registration with email verification
- Secure login with password hashing
- JWT token-based session management
- Password reset functionality
- Role-based access control (admin, user, guest)

## Design Considerations
- Use bcrypt for password hashing
- Implement rate limiting for login attempts
- Store JWT tokens securely (httpOnly cookies)
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Implement proper error handling and logging

## Technical Stack
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: JWT + bcrypt
- Frontend: React with context for auth state

## TODOs

- [ ] Design database schema for users table
- [ ] Create user registration endpoint
- [ ] Implement email verification system
- [ ] Create login endpoint with JWT generation
- [ ] Add password reset functionality
- [ ] Implement middleware for protected routes
- [ ] Create frontend authentication context
- [ ] Add login/register forms
- [ ] Implement route protection on frontend
- [ ] Add logout functionality
- [ ] Write unit tests for auth endpoints
- [ ] Write integration tests for auth flow
- [ ] Add error handling and validation
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add logging for security events
