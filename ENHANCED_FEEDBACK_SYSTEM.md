# Enhanced Workflow Feedback System

## 🎯 Problem Solved

The Mira extension was experiencing two critical UX issues:

1. **Vague LLM Responses**: When users sent unclear prompts like "design the calculator function in the issue title", the LLM would respond vaguely without asking for clarification
2. **Poor User Experience**: Users had no visibility into the SPARC workflow progress, making the extension feel unresponsive

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Confidence-Based User Feedback System**

**What it does:**
- Analyzes user input for clarity and specificity
- Calculates confidence score (0.0 to 1.0)
- Detects vague patterns and missing information
- Provides helpful guidance when confidence is low

**Key Features:**
- **Pattern Detection**: Identifies vague requests like "design the calculator function"
- **Missing Information Analysis**: Detects what specific details are needed
- **Smart Suggestions**: Provides example questions and clearer request formats
- **Real-time Feedback**: Shows guidance immediately in webview

**Example Response for Vague Input:**
```
🤔 Your request needs more details!

❌ Missing Information:
- Specific programming language
- Detailed functionality requirements
- Input/output specifications
- Performance requirements
- Error handling needs

💡 Please provide more details:
1. What programming language should I use? (e.g., Python, JavaScript, TypeScript)
2. What specific operations should the calculator support?
3. What should be the input format?
4. Are there any specific requirements?
5. Should it handle special cases like division by zero?

📝 Example of a clear request:
Instead of: "design the calculator function"
Try: "Create a Python calculator function that supports basic arithmetic..."
```

### 2. **Real-Time Workflow Progress Display**

**What it does:**
- Shows live SPARC workflow progress in a dedicated webview
- Displays current phase, step, and progress percentage
- Provides visual indicators for each workflow stage
- Updates in real-time as workflow executes

**Key Features:**
- **Phase Tracking**: Shows Specification → Architecture → Completion phases
- **Step Progress**: Individual step completion with progress bars
- **Visual Indicators**: Icons and colors for pending/running/completed/failed states
- **Duration Tracking**: Shows estimated and actual execution times
- **Error Handling**: Displays errors with clear messaging

**SPARC Workflow Steps Displayed:**
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### **Demo Commands Available:**

1. **`mimie.runEnhancedWorkflowDemo`** - Run complete enhanced workflow with confidence feedback
2. **`mimie.testConfidenceAnalysis`** - Test confidence analysis with sample inputs
3. **`mimie.showWorkflowProgressDemo`** - Open workflow progress panel

### **Testing Confidence Feedback:**

1. Run `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Mira: Run Enhanced Workflow Demo"
2. Enter vague input: "design the calculator function in the issue title"
3. See confidence feedback appear immediately
4. Try clear input: "Create a Python calculator function that supports basic arithmetic (+, -, *, /) with error handling for division by zero"

### **Viewing Workflow Progress:**

1. Run `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Mira: Show Workflow Progress Demo"
2. Start any workflow
3. See real-time progress updates
4. Watch phases and steps complete with visual indicators

## 📁 Files Created

### **Core Feedback System:**
- `src/feedback/userFeedbackManager.ts` - Confidence analysis and feedback generation
- `src/feedback/workflowFeedbackService.ts` - VSCode integration and webview management
- `src/feedback/enhancedWorkflowExecutor.ts` - Workflow execution with progress tracking
- `src/feedback/enhancedWorkflowDemoCommands.ts` - Demo commands and testing

### **Webview Components:**
- `src/webview/workflowProgress.html` - Real-time progress display interface

### **Integration:**

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Confidence Analysis Algorithm:**
```typescript
// Pattern detection for vague requests
const vaguePatterns = [
    /design.*function/i,
    /create.*something/i,
    /build.*app/i,
    /make.*calculator/i
];

// Confidence calculation
let confidence = 1.0;
if (isVague) confidence -= 0.4;
if (missingInfo.length > 0) confidence -= (missingInfo.length * 0.1);
if (userInput.length < 20) confidence -= 0.2;
```

### **Real-Time Progress Updates:**
```typescript
// Progress tracking with visual updates
const progressData: WorkflowProgress = {
    phase: 'Specification',
    step: 'Requirements Analysis',
    progress: 75,
    status: 'running',
    message: 'Currently analyzing user requirements...',
    estimatedTime: 30000
};
```

### **Webview Communication:**
```typescript
// Send updates to webview
this.feedbackService.sendWorkflowProgress(progressData);
this.feedbackService.sendConfidenceFeedback(analysis, userInput);
```
