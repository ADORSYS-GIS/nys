# üìñ SPARC Workflow System - Complete Guide

## üéØ **Overview**

The SPARC Workflow System transforms development from ad-hoc coding to structured, traceable workflows. Every development task becomes an issue that progresses through three distinct phases: **Design ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Debug**.

## üìÇ **Issue Folder Structure**

Each development task is organized in a dedicated issue folder for complete traceability:

```
/issues/ISSUE-001/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.md   # Generated requirements & technical specs
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ guidelines.md     # Style guides, dependencies, coding constraints  
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ notes.md          # Iterations, debug notes, brainstorming
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ status.json       # Tracks mode (design/build/debug), progress, state
```

## üîÑ **Workflow Modes**

### **üé® Design Mode**

**Purpose**: Transform user requirements into detailed technical specifications.

**Input**: 
- User prompt describing the problem or feature request

**Process**:
1. **Analysis**: Parse user input to understand the core problem
2. **Research**: Analyze existing codebase and project structure
3. **Specification**: Generate detailed requirements and technical specs
4. **Guidelines**: Create development standards and constraints
5. **Planning**: Define project structure and implementation approach

**Output**:
- `requirements.md` with complete technical specification
- `guidelines.md` with development standards
- Updated `status.json` with design progress

**Example Design Mode Workflow**:
```
User Input: "I need a user authentication system for my web app"

Design Mode Processing:

- **State Management**: Track workflow progress and issue status
- **Version Control**: Integration with Git for change tracking

## üß† **State Management**

### **Workflow State**
Tracks progress within each mode:
- Current step in the workflow
- Completed tasks and remaining work
- Error states and recovery information
- Tool usage and results

### **Issue State**
Maintained in `status.json` for each issue:
- Current mode (design/build/debug)
- Progress percentages for each mode
- Last activity and next steps
- Creation and update timestamps

### **Project State**
Reflects the current codebase:
- File structure and organization
- Dependencies and configurations
- Generated code and artifacts
- Integration points and APIs

### **Mode Switching**
Smooth transitions between workflow modes:
- State preservation across mode changes
- Context transfer between modes
- Progress tracking and resumption
- Error handling and recovery

## üöÄ **End-to-End Workflow Example**

### **Step 1: Create Issue**
```
User: "I need a REST API for managing blog posts"

System: Creates /issues/BLOG-API-001/ folder
```

### **Step 2: Design Mode**
