# Nys - SPARC Workflow-Driven Development Assistant

A Visual Studio Code extension that implements a **workflow-driven assistant** based on the **SPARC framework** (Specification → Pseudocode → Architecture → Refinement → Completion). The assistant is **issue-driven**: every new task is stored as an *issue folder*, and each issue goes through **Design → Build → Debug** modes for systematic development.
