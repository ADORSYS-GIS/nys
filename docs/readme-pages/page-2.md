## 🎯 **Core Philosophy**

Mira transforms development from ad-hoc coding to structured, traceable workflows. Every development task becomes an issue that progresses through three distinct phases:

- **🎨 Design Mode**: Analyze requirements, generate specifications, and create technical guidelines
- **🔨 Build Mode**: Generate code, create project structure, and implement features  
- **🐛 Debug Mode**: Identify issues, apply fixes, and optimize performance

This ensures every piece of code has clear requirements, documented decisions, and traceable evolution.
