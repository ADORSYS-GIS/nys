## ðŸ“‚ **Issue Folder Structure**

Each development task is organized in a dedicated issue folder for complete traceability:

```
/issues/ISSUE-001/
   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.md   # Generated requirements & technical specs
   â”œâ”€â”€ guidelines.md     # Style guides, dependencies, coding constraints  
   â”œâ”€â”€ notes.md          # Iterations, debug notes, brainstorming
   â”œâ”€â”€ status.json       # Tracks mode (design/build/debug), progress, state
```
